6. Save and you're ready to go!

The built-in configuration panel provides:

- ‚úÖ Copy-to-clipboard buttons for all required URLs
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation of your OAuth credentials
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting guide for common issues

**‚öôÔ∏è Alternative: Environment Variables**

For development, you can also create a `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
VITE_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth-callback.html
